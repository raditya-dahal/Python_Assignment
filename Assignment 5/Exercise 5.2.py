"""
Findings:
1. Profit along with expenditures in R&D, marketing, and administration.
2. Correlation analysis suggests 'R&D Spend' and 'Marketing Spend' have the highest correlation with profit.
3. Scatter plots confirm a nearly linear relationship between these variables and profit.
4. The 'State' column was one-hot encoded but not used in the model since it has little impact.
5. The linear regression model was trained using an 80/20 split.
6. RMSE and R2 values indicate model performance.
